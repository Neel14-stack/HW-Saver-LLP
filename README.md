## Overview📝
We have a raw dataset of over 30k datapoints **(Raw_Skills_Dataset.csv)** which contain technical skills and a lot of jargon mixed in.
I developed a code that can clean this dataset and extract Technical skills. I stored the required output in a CSV file name **output.csv** and the approach I used in **Approach_Report**.
